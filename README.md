#ðŸ§  MNIST Image Classification
A simple deep learning project to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

#ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a basic image classification model trained on the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), commonly used for benchmarking machine learning models in image classification tasks.
